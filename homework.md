# Lesson 1 Homework

## 1. Feynman Writing Promps

* Variables:
    Variables are a computer's way of saving something for later and remembering what it's called.  It has a 
    name that it's given and it has stuff that can go inside of it.  It's similar to a little labeled box that 
    is as big as whatever is inside of it.  You write what it is on it and then put something in it.  You can 
    pass that box around, take the thing out and mess with it, change it or even replace it completely.  The box, 
    however, is still there.  That's a variable.  The same things can be done to a variable, just in a computer.
* Functions:
    Functions are sets of instructions that have a name, the different things that you might need for that 
    recipe and what is supposed to come out at the end.  Well, a function has `arguments`.  Those `arguments` 
    are the things that the recipe might need, like how many of them you are making, what flavors you add or 
    what icing you are using The recipe is still the same, it just needs the `arguments` to know how you 
    want the cake to turn out this time.  The cake at the end, or in my case, the burnt thing I am told to 
    never try to make again, is the result. A function `returns` the result.  A function uses `return` commands 
    to tell whoever is using the recipe this time what came out, whether it's a beautiful cake with chocolate 
    chips, or that burnt thing.
* If statements:
    If statements are decisions.  "Tommy, did you do your homework?" Tommy's mom will want to know this one, so 
    she asks him.  An `if` is a command that we can use to ask questions, like this: 
    `if( tommys_homework = done )`
    
    So if Tommy's homework is done, we get an answer.  Sometimes we would use `if` statements to control 
    whether or not something happens, like if Tommy wants to go outside, his homework has to be done.
* Booleans:
    A `boolean` is a funny-sounding word that is something our computers look for.  Things that are yes or 
    no, true or false, real or no;  Those are like booleans.  Something that isn't fuzzy and has an 
    absolute answer.  In the computer's terms, though, booleans are only ever written as `true` or `false`. 
    They are special statements that we can get from the computer, like if we asked if Tommy's homework was 
    done!  If Tommy's homework was done, it would be `true`, but if not, `false`.  Those are the only real 
    answers.  Obviously, we can ask more questions to find out more information.

## 2. Install Node and NPM. NPM comes packaged with Node.
    **Done!**

## 3. Install SublimeText3. If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that.
    **Atom Aquired. Done!**

## 4. Download this project folder from GitHub.
    **Forked and ready to go.  Done!**

5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows). `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.
    **Done!**

6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`. This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.
    **Done!**

7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests. At first all of the tests will be broken. You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
    **Done!**
